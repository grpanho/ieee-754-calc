# IEEE-754-Calc

Simple "calculator" for basic operations with floats that points out the IEEE-754 exceptions when they occur.

## How To Use

Compiling: `make`

Testing: `make try`

Remember to compile before running try!

Cleaning: `make clean`


**The make file was made just for Linux with gcc! It still can be compiled for other systems.**
